# UOM Java Exercises

This repository will contain all of the exercises we have to solve in the [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) class during the third semester in my university, some of them are mandatory and some of the are not, but, if they are mandatory or not **I will solve all of them** and publish the solutions in this repository regardless.

<br>

This repository will be updated roughly once a week since this is when I can get my hands on the exercises that I need to solve, although the schedule **might fluctuate** for a variety of reasons.

## Notes

Now, if you expect anything hard then I am sorry to dissapoint you but there won't be anything advanced in this repository, **although** because I am currently taking the class I may be proven wrong in the following month or so.

Also, if for some reason you are a member in the same class as me and you think you can get off the hook the easy way, **shame on you**, don't copy and paste code for a grade you don't deserve.
